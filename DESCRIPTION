Description: Estimates the Concordance Correlation Coefficient to assess agreement. The scenarios considered are non-repeated measures, non-longitudinal repeated measures (replicates) and longitudinal repeated measures. It also includes the estimation of the one-way intraclass correlation coefficient also known as reliability index. The estimation approaches implemented are variance components and U-statistics approaches. Description of methods can be found in Fleiss (1986) <doi:10.1002/9781118032923> and Carrasco et al. (2013) <doi:10.1016/j.cmpb.2012.09.002>.
